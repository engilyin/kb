✔️ The evolution: Thread → Executor → ExecutorService → Future → CompletableFuture
✔️ Why manually creating threads is a BAD idea in real systems
✔️ Thread pools explained with diagrams (Fixed, Cached, Scheduled, Work-Stealing)
✔️ How ExecutorService manages task submission, queueing & scheduling
✔️ Future API — limitations & blocking problems
✔️ Deep dive into CompletableFuture:
async supply & run
chaining (thenApply, thenCompose)
combining (allOf, anyOf)
exception handling (exceptionally, handle)
timeouts
✔️ How the ForkJoinPool works internally
✔️ Real backend examples:
Parallel API calls
Async DB fetch
Background jobs
Microservice fan-out patterns
✔️ Thread starvation, deadlocks & how to avoid them
✔️ Clean diagrams to visualize async flows
✔️ Interview traps:
Why Future is outdated
What makes CompletableFuture truly non-blocking
When to avoid common async mistakes
