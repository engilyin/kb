# Architecture Process

## Process

### Solution Requirements Analysis
1. Business drivers
2. Stakeholders
3. Functional Requirements
4. Quality attribute requirements, assumptions, constraints
5. Baseline architecture and gaps

### Solution Design

6. Target architecture
7. Transition

### Solution Delivery
8. WBS, estimates
9.  Resource plan, timeline, roadmap
10. PoC

### Process Structure

- Enterprise Architecture
- System Architecture
- Software Architecture
  - Structures:
    - Module
    - Component and Connectors
    - Allocations
  - Architecture Business Cycle
- Quality Attributes
  - Collected during Quality Attribute Workshop
    - Functional Requirements
    - Quality Requirements
    - Design Constraints
    - Patterns, Tactics
  - Documented Using Scenarios

## Review

`ATAM`: Architecture Trade-Off Analysis Method (SEI):
Phases:
0. Partnership/Preparation
1. Initial evaluation
2. Complete eveluation
3. Follow-up

### Phase 1

1. Present `ATAM`
   - evaluation team explains the process to the stakeholders
   - answers questions
   - presents overview of `ATAM`:
     - `ATAM` steps in brief
     - Techniques: utility tree generation, scenario brainstorming etc
     - Outputs: architecture approaches, utility tree, risks, non-risks, sensitivity points, trade-offs
2. Present Business Drivers, including its:
   - Business Context
   - Functional requirements
   - Quality Attributes requirements
3. Present Architecture including:
   - Tech constraints
   - Interaction with external systems
   - Architecture approaches used to address quality attributes requirements
4. Identify Architectural Approaches. The evaluators begin to identify palaces that are key to realizing quality attribute goals
5. Generate Quality Attribute Utility Tree
6. Analyze architectural approaches:
   - Identifies the architectural approaches and architectural decisions made
   - Asks the quality attribute related questions
   - Documents risks, non-risks, sensitivity points, trade-offs
