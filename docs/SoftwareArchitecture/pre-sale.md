# Pre-Sales

## Terms

- `Request for Information (RFI)` is used to get more information about and from vendors. It is usually issued before `RFP` and `RFQ`
- `Request for Proposal (RFP)` is issued to request a solution solving a problem. This is the most formal of the pre-sale process and has strict procurement rules for content, timeline and vendor responses.
- `Request for Quotation (RFQ)` is used when discussions with bidders are not required(mainly when the specifications of a product or service are already known) and when price is the main or only factor in selecting the successful bidder. An RFQ may also be used prior to issuing a full-blown RFP to determine general price ranges.

## Process

1. Qualification and kick-off
2. Q&A session
3. Proposal preparation
4. Pre-final review
5. Proposal submission
6. Post-mortem


## Work on Design Steps

1. **Define functional scope**: user scenarios, major use cases, workflows
   - **Feature Decomposition**
   - **Work Breakdown Structure (WBS)** per component:
     - Define project scope
     - Groups typical elements of work by activities/deliverables
     - Serves as a foundation for
       - Estimations
       - Project Schedule
       - Resource Plan
2. **Understand system context**: boundary between solution in scope and full environment, showing external systems solution will interact with.
3. **Identify architecture significant requirements (ASR)**
4. Create high-level design: develop a solution approach and the architecture addressing ASRs.

## Techniques for Estimations

- Analogy-based estimation
- Bottom up estimation based on WBS
- Parametric models
- Expert estimation
- Group estimation

## Timeline

- Understand project duration
- Allocate resources
- Identify dependencies (task)
- Create/Review/Optimize schedule
- Identify main milestones

## Resource Plan

The `Resource Plan` contains a proposal on the team setup and structure (roles, responsibilities, amount) required to deliver project scope within a specific time frame.

## RFP Response

1. Executive Summary
2. Company Overview
3. Solution Approach
   - Scope Understanding
   - Proposed Solution
4. Delivery Approach
   - Project Methodology
   - Proposed Team
   - Timeline
5. Pricing
6. Assumptions
   - General Assumptions
   - Technical Assumptions
7. Relevant Case Studies

## Engagement Models

- `Stuff Augmentation`
- `Project-Based`
- `Offshore Development Center`
- `Product Development Services`
- `Digital Platform Engineering Services`
- `Consultancy`

## Pricing Models

- Time and Materials (T&M)
- Time and Materials with Threshold
- Fixed Price
- Outcome-Bases (SLA-Based)

## Contracts

- Non-Disclosure Agreement
- Master Service Agreement
- Statement of Work (SoW)
- Change Order (CO)
