# Software Architecture Terminology

## Driver -> Goal -> Objective

- `BUSINESS DRIVER` is an internal or external change or
impact which indicates a reaction from the business.
This impact is not necessarily negative. It includes:
    - Business context
    - Functional requirements
    - Quality Attributes requirements

- `BUSINESS GOAL` represents a high-level statement of
intent, direction, or desired end state for an organization
and its stakeholders

- `BUSINESS OBJECTIVE` is an actionable item needed to
achieve business goals.


## Values vs Capabilities

- `BUSINESS VALUE` is the generated value like concrete
products or services.

- `BUSINESS CAPABILITIES` describe what a company does and what this company is able (or needs) to do to be
successful. To achieve capabilities, a combination of organization, people, processes, and technology may be required.

   - Each capability is unique.
   - Capabilities are stable.
   - Capabilities are abstracted from the organizational model. 
   - Capabilities can be defined for any organizational unit.
   - Individual capabilities do not have a purpose.

## BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE

`BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE` is a representation of holistic,
multi-dimensional business views of: capabilities, end-to-end
value delivery, information, and organizational structure; and
the relationships among these business views and strategies,
products, policies, initiatives, and stakeholders

`BUSINESS ARCHITECTURE` covers the following core aspects of a business: capabilities, information,
organization, and value streams (as defined in the BIZBOK® Guide)

- `CAPABILITY` - What a business does
(*Capability Map, Business Services, Business Functions*)
- `VALUE` - How a business delivers value to its customers
(*Value Proposition, Value Stream Mapping*)
- `INFORMATION` - Information concepts, on IT level represented
by data (*information map*)
- `ORGANIZATION` - Organization structure, organization map


### CAPABILITY

`CAPABILITY MAP` - A business capability map (or business capability model) is a holistic set of capabilities that
constitute what an enterprise does.

`VALUE STREAM` is a representation of an end-to-end
collection of value-adding activities that create an overall
result for a customer, stakeholder, or end user.

A value stream is the set of actions that take place to add value to a customer from the initial request through
realization of value by the customer. The value stream begins with the initial concept, moves through various
stages of development and on through delivery and support. A value stream always begins and ends with a
customer

### ORGANIZATION

An organizational chart shows the internal structure of an organization (departments, groups, teams) in a
hierarchical way.

It is crucial to understand how organizational structures are mapped into the business architecture, and which
stakeholders involved.

`CONWAY’S LAW` Any organization that designs a system (defined broadly)
will produce a design whose structure is a copy of the
organization's communication structure.”
