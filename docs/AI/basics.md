# Artificial Intelligence


## Key Terms

- `Feature` is an isolated quality of data which is extracted from training dataset and included into ML model
- `Selection` is a process of choosing the features which are required to explain the predictive power of a statistical model and dropping out irrelevant features
- `Vector` is a fundamental element of linear algebra. Used throughout the field of machine learning in the description of algorithms and processes such as the target variable (y) when training an algorithm.
- `Matrix` is a rectangular array of numbers, symbols, or expressions, arranged in rows and columns
- `Tensors` are geometric objects that describe linear relations between geometric vectors, scalars, and other tensors.
- `Model` is the essence of `ML` algorithm which defines the logic of algorithms' work
- `Training` is the process of `ML` algorithm ingesting training data in order to build an `ML` model which provides predictions.
- `Evaluation` is the process of qualifying outcomes of `ML` models on expected results
- `Prediction` is an ability to forecast future with the help of available data and `ML` algorithm.
